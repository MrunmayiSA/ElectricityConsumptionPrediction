# Electricity Consumption Prediction using Time Series Analysis

* Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kandij/electric-production

In this project, I learnt how to visualize time series, make it stationary and predict values for future
* Visualized Time Series
* Checked for stationarity using ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test
* Removed trends by moving averages and seasonality by differencing
* Constructed ACF and PACF plots to get the values of p and q
* Fitted ARIMA model with RSS of 0.52 and predicted consumption for the period 2017-2024
